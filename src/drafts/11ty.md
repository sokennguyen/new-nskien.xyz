process of creating a SSG blog with CMS:

SSG: 11ty:



CMS:  strapi

- Strapi requires old version of Node (active LTS versions - either 18.x or 20.x) => need nvm (node version manager)



Strapi needs heavy reconfiguration => Pivoted to Decap

***<u>Decap installation need to put in .eleventy.js:</u>***

```js
eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("./src/admin/");
```

**REMEMBER TO ADD "`---`" AT THE START OF FILE IN config.yml**

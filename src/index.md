## Hello! I'm Kien.

I write about learning, design, software, and ideas.



I create stuff to learn, hoping those things will become cool someday.

You can reach me via [e-mail](mailto:%20nsongkien@gmail.com). I always response, but not quickly.
Please share your favorite jokes, books, [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7ISChHyzVFTHl4H8rgu85G?si=e9a5bc24d5e64823), [movies](https://letterboxd.com/nskien/likes/films/), etc.

You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sokennguyen) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kien-nguyen-song-960b92219/).

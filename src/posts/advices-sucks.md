## The trails fades

The thing is that I'm not saying this when I didn't try the advices that others gave me, as I've certainly have had. I tried the advices from the people that I admire, from people that seems cool to me, from people that are rich, from people that are poor, and even from people that I didn't even respect.
All of the attempts of listening to advices all falls back into the same path again, which being the path of non relevancy. The advices I tried from other people works well, some very effective, yet only lasted for a couple of days, then I fall back at my previous path that I was following, then hate myself for such poor performance. 
As the nature of all life, **they are all different from each other**. Some people's advice are based on the things that they, and only they themselves experienced. Then they formed personal lessons from those experiences. This factor only makes every advices in the world personal, and I doubt they'd work in the attempt of improving others lives. 
This is the reason why relevancy falls, therefore the trust for such advices fades, and all when back to the way before, again and again.

## Tired and frustrated 

I'm so done with following advices. It is throwing your time away into a garbage truck like it doesn't have any value. Heck, that equals to throwing your life away, then should you just die instead, to not cause trouble for others? 
From now on I say fuck the advices, fuck the books, fuck the talks and all of the fancy promises that means nothing outside of the life of the advice-giver. **I'M FIGURING THIS PATH OUT OF MY OWN!!!**
If it looks crazy to other people, so be it. If it looks terrifying to other people, so be it. If it scares other people out of my life, so be it. If my mom and my dad and my grandma and my grandads and my brother don't think the path or the advices I give my is cool and good, they will do later on when I figure this thing called life out.
And if those people around me start giving advices to me AGAIN? "not to be disrespectful to you, BUT I DON'T GIVE A DAMN, and I'm not sorry for thinking that way". 

## Doing things out of love and passion

So this is it, the first thought about what should I do with this precious thing that I called life. one shot, one chance, and I **WILL** make the shot. Nothing can stop me as the things I do is the fire inside my heart, this is the wood that fuels my body, the fertilisation that grows me, the dreams I have at night, and the thoughts I have in during my days. 
Life is sooooooooo fucking short my man, and I cannot stand a single day further to do things that is not lightening up my soul and my heart. How a waist it is, to live another day of suffering, of keeping my head down, of creating a barrier to the wonderful nature of passion. Wake up and start feeding the fire, my man, cuz it's looking like it's about to vanished.
I say be crazy, I say do what the heart is yelling, be a slave to your heart and pursue that ambition, that goal, that love until the end and not give up, ever. And if the heart switch it's love after the high of the pursuit, let it go. I'll be bold, literally and philosophically. I don't give a damn about others. I'll be arrogant, hard to convince, cuz others don't know shit bout me. 

As I'm writing this, I can see your assumptions about the person of my own based on the way I use my language, but sorry for not sorry, I don't really care. I'm angry, with myself and grieving for the time that I have passed away meaninglessly. 
I will allow myself to be inspired by other great people, but to do things in my life, I will follow my heart and not my terrible mind. I will follow the fire that burn inside of me. No, not my body, but my feeling about the work that I currently do. Am I excited for it? Is the light still there? Am I good with it? If not, I know that I will if I try hard enough to learn it. 

## Hard work always comes first, enjoyment comes after

Be resilient. Hard work must be accomplished firsts. If I am dreaded by the things that I do, and I know that is the fire in me? I punch through it and the fire will light up again, they always do

I am a crazy ass person, I am weird, and that weirdness, craziness, recklessness IS my tool for me to pave the path of MY own. Creating something that is great for others, love the creations of mine, love the people that I create them for, to me is the purpose of life, because one day, I will be dead, and all of my joy, my pleasure doesn't comes through, only hard work, usefulness, and love for life that will be the only remainders. I do things because I love them, not because I have to do them.

BE CRAZY IN LOVE WITH THE THINGS I DO, ENJOY IT EVERY SECOND, THAT IS THE KEY TO LIFE

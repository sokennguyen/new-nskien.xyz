How to know what to do with life:

Life have no meaning, that is the base for everything in life, and the one thing you need to remember in every decision in life.

Because life has no meaning, you can do whatever the fuck you please, no guilt.

If doing charity, that is, giving your time, intelligence, talent, or money to others provides you a large amount of pleasure to your life, do it, but know that it is not your purpose in life.

Doing anything besides charity is for your own self. Heck, even with the benefits of doing charity is for your own pleasure, of feeling superior, of feeling useful, of being purposeful ect.

That makes doing everything is for yourself, period. Feel no guilt in doing anything, besides doing harm to others. You don't have no purpose when you were born, there are no universe telling you what you're supposed to do with your life, there are no ultimate goals destined for you. That is not a depressing claim, but rather the most liberating thought you can hear right now, if you have been having existential crises. That's why you've clicked on this link, right?

That is the first thing you need to understand and always remember, especially when you are questioning your direction in life. With that block out of the way, you have a series of block that is in the same category. I call this series of block "living basics".

Living basics are just that, the basics that allow you to live decently. This includes food, shelter, 7 pieces of shirts max, some pair of pants, underwear, one piece of footwear of normal weather, one piece of footwear for extreme weathers, hygene stuff, a smart phone, a laptop, a pair of headphone (anykind works, as long as they block sounds).

I'm being autisticly specific because more is not nessecarally better. It is needless to say that if you absolutely need something, otherwise your quality of life drastically decreses, then you can add that to the list. 

You may ask what is the point of this list, because it is not very difficult to achieve? The catch here is that is that the list is not achievable if you care very much about what others think about you, and not achievable right the way if you are not born with enough money to begin with. 

Having only the things on the list might get you weird looks from the people around you, even the people you love and love you. If you can't stand that then it's not possible to get through this block.

Having the things on this list means that you HAVE it, and you don't need to worry about getting them, or not worry that you will at some point run out of them in the future.

It might take further explenation than my simple explanation. If you want that, you can look further into the subject of Financial Independence (if you see this bracket, that means I've forgetten to include some recomemmed readings, sorry ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). The whole idea of this concept is by freeing yourself from financial burdens, you are freeing your mind and time to live life on own term.

When you get the whys, let's get to the hows. You can achieve this list of things by working for money, and limit your spendings to this list of estentials. You will naturally have surplus after you spend, so you will then invest those surplus, which will generate a passive income which then will pay for your list of essentials. One thing to note that the list of essentials into two things: a healthy body and formalities. You can get a healthy body for cheap, and formality is cheaper the less you need it.

By getting rid of the first and second block, you are ready get to know what you should do with your life. Without the guilt of chosing what to spend your time on, and without the financial burden, you will have the ability to freely do whatever it is that capture your interest. Start right at the first thought, do it until you bump into other things that you think is even better than the first one. Do it until you don't see any better thing to do. You'd be surprise when you look back at what you've achieve while reaching that final thing that captivates your interest.

What is the thing that I should do with my life? I don't know yet because I have not yet get the free mind and time of financial independence. That is what I'm working toward. When I'm there, the first thing that comes to my mind would be the thing that I will spend my time on.

You are the only one who knows how each of your body part works.\
Your body parts sometimes work alone, sometimes they work with other body parts.\
Eyes, mouth, and hands behave without my brain most of the time.\
I think this mechanism exist to save brain's energy.\
Eyes, hands and mouth behave habitually when not controlled mindfully with the brain.

Through your environment and circumstances, your body parts learns what it had to do with the help of your brain and made it a habit.\
When the habits are formed, the brain doesn't engaged when the body parts perform those habitual behaviours.\
When they are not lead by the brain like this, the brain can either put off giving out thoughts, or the body parts will influence what the brain sees.\
When mouth speaks before brain thinks, words put out by the mouth dictates what the brain thinks in that moment.\
When eyes see things that are not what the brain is thinking, it projects irrelevant images into the brain.

So be mindful when facing something important.\
Take a moment to gather your thoughts before saying something major.\
Think with your brain for a while before letting your eyes indoctrinate you with glamorous looking sights.\
Sing to yourself in the head so that you don't have to hear sharps words that cut through your gut, leaving permanent scars.

But there aren't always scenarios that you're brain has time to think.\
This is when you have to trust that other parts of your body have learned to react well enough for the situations.\
But when you fail at a situation that you aren't familiar with, and everything happens fast in that event, don't blame your brain for it.\
Use it to figure out what your body should've reacted, so that it knows how to handle similar situations in the future. 

Your body also needs YOU to love it.\
You need to say love to yourself, no matter how corny it is.\
You dire for love, and not much people will say love to you.\
You are the only one who can see what you have done and what you're going through.\
You are the only one who knows what you need to hear.\
So talk to yourself. Say kind words to your heart so that it gets some of the love it needed.\
Some say this is arrogant, that it's ignorance. I call this giving myself a break.\
I think it's good to remind ourselves what we've accomplished and use them as fuel to proceed.

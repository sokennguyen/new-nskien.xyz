One things seems so right when you really squeeze out every inch of rationality to explain it.

But such thing is also true when you try and ration about the opposite ideas.

This is especially the case when we discuss about the meaning of life.\
"What should we do with our life" have always been the debate since the dawn of the human race.

The debate doesn't have an ending, because all of the perspectives are logically correct.\
But then we look took another perspective, the original ideas of living are so wrong.

Pursuing monetary riches is the way to live, but living peacefully without the care of wealth is also the way to live.\
Both of them have their reasons to be correct, and reasons to be wrong when looking from the opposite viewpoint.

So since everything is right, and everything is wrong, I think that we should just choose something and go with it without further worries.

The decision will be right, yet still wrong, no matter what we choose.

The worst I can do is not deciding, and therefore not doing anything with my life.

Choosing how to live based on other people's opinions is one way to make that decision.\
Choosing not to listen to other people is the better option though, because you've made that choice with your own reasonings.

But whatever path I choose, I can be assured that sometimes I'll will think the decision is right, and wrong at other times.\
When I think it's wrong, I then will be able to decide to continue down that path or not.\
I then need to make that decision, with the knowledge that the decision will be both right, and wrong.

Choose your reason to live, and live with it.\
For the moment, ignore the other options.\
For the moment, your decision is right, and the others are wrong.\
Just live, and you've successfully living.

Note: Sometimes I wish that I'm stupid enough to just do things without considering other options.

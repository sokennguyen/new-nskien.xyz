What's stopping us from living like [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io) when he was [reseting his life](https://levels.io/reset-your-life/)?

> I was already living minimalist but it still took me about 4 months to exit my life in Amsterdam, getting rid of my apartment, the interior and all the rest of my stuff and prepare my escape from Europe. I had 2 boxes of memories and nostalgia at my parents. I broke down my super fast workstation PC and sold the parts online. I sold my DSLR camera I used for making music videos, camera stands, and all my musical equipment. Selling the camera was difficult because it also meant that the music videos and the YouTube projects my friend Jim and I worked on would end. It would end anyway though since Iâ€™d leave the country. I raised about $3,000 selling everything on eBay. I used this money to buy a MacBook so I could work anywhere.

> I was now left with a MacBook, an external hard drive with all my data, 4 t-shirts, 2 pants, 6 pieces of underwear and 6 pair of socks

>Life is like the best video game ever, it has amazing graphics, infinite amounts of levels, a huge map and this ridiculous great freedom. I just needed to pick up the controller.

> It's normal to be socially awkward.
>
> It's normal to be scared of everything.

> And it's so easy when you're 20, it's harder when you're 30.

> So yeah, have fun.

> You can go anywhere.
>
> You can go to Uganda, you can go live there.
>
> You can go live in Japan or in Uruguay or Chile.

> Or if you're a European, you go live in New York. You've always wanna live in Brooklyn, go live in Brooklyn. It's fucking expensive though but yeah, try. I lived in Brooklyn just to be able to say I live in Brooklyn, like, it's so cool.

> You can go, you can live anywhere.

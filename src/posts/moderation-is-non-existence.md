Either all in or nothing.

Either full abstence or full indulgence.

There is no such thing as moderation, because the thing you're trying to "balance" or "moderate" is the things that you've already know you're not supposed to do. They are things that are against your value.

By doing only just a little of the things against your values is the same as treating your values lightly.

This is disrespecting your inteligence and integrity.

And because you've already disrespected the value, your brain hide the value away by the form of forgetting.

But there's always a moment that the value comes back to you after being forgotten.

This is the time where you can either capture the value down into paper and live by it.

Or you can just remember it in the back of your head, quit the thing you're trying to "moderate" cold turkey, and forgetting the value some day and give in to the cravings.

Remember, it takes just one slip to falsify your believes, and without your believes, you'll start to freefall into the things that you're not supposed to do.

One value crumbles can and most often will collapse other values.

When one value are being betrayed, you start to give up your other values because you loose trust in your judgements.

This is what I mean of falling into a spiral of the things that you're not supposed to do.

So either completely stay away from the things you know you're not supposed to do, or do it once or twice and mess every believe up.

Moderation is one big lie that you've taught by society, and it makes zero sense when you stop and think about it.

A man surely has enough intelligence to notice that he is a hypocrite when saying something is bad but do it.

A hypocrite can't trust himself and all of the values that he's adopted.

But there is a fix for this problem, and it's an obvious fix.

Adapt your values, and stick to it.

Just change your self identity from the person who do the bad thing from time, to the person that just don't do that bad thing ever.

The bad thing has no relation to you. You and it do not have any knowledge of each other.

That's how you stay true to yourself.

Moderation is one big lie.

Either all in or nothing.

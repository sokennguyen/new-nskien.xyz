Day by day, when I [turn the Internet off](/posts/nonet), sound is the first thing that vanishes in an instant, and I don't become at peace with that event easily.

Flickering instruments from music, people's voices and ideas from podcasts or videos, altogether stop scouring into my head in just a split of a second.

Calmness rushes through, shoulders drop.

Consumed with the shock from the sudden silence, I stood for a moment.

Ears still ringing from the earphones, which I thought were on just enough volume. Turns out they were too loud, otherwise my ears wouldn't be ringing like this.

The buzzing slowly phases away, and during such seconds, there came a realisation that I've just once again lower my hearing ability.

But as the buzzing noise phases, other lively sounds start appearing again. Footsteps, finger-tapping, car engines, wind hissing through the old wooden window start filling up the atmosphere.

I then hear my thoughts speaking up again, after I have allowed them to do so. Such voice is so little but frantic because it is used to the fast moving things I have been listening to on the web. But soon, too, that voice becomes calmer by the minutes.

And just like that, the brain jumps into motion again. Ideas pop up, connections start forming, and answers slowly showing themselves from the mist.

Perhaps the most frequent voices that we hear should come from within ourselves, not from everybody else's all the time. With that, we can make our own evaluations, forge our own ideas, and decipher the experiences that we've been through to make the decisions that can only be made by ourselves, not some random stranger online.
